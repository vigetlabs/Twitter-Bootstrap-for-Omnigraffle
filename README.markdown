TWITTER BOOTSTRAP FOR OMNIGRAFFLE

========================================

This is a set of Omnigraffle stencils, colors, and templates that mirror [Twitter Bootstrap](http://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) as closely as possible. 


INSTALLATION
------------

Install as few or as many items as you need. Drag or copy the following files to the appropriate destination folders. 

*Note*: OSX Lion hides the user's Library folder by default. You can show it by opening Terminal.app and issuing the following command `chflags nohidden ~/Library/`. ([Source: OSX Daily](http://osxdaily.com/2011/07/22/access-user-library-folder-in-os-x-lion/))
